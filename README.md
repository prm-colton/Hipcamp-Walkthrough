# Hipcamp-Walkthrough

This repository contains a real Hipcamp delivery log, `Real_Delivery_Log.txt`, with confidential information redacted. This is a raw file that is very large. 
For clients, Promoted provides an introspection report that details the contents of the log in format that is easier to read and debug, in addition to providing the raw data.

See the walkthrough for more details and for guidance on interpreting the log: https://docs.promoted.ai/docs/promoted-integration-walkthrough
